# Artificial_Int_Capstone_Project

Hi, My name is Altamash.
I along with my other 3 team members have programmed a machine learning model which can detect a drowsy driver and trigger an manager side alarm 
and can avoid accidents.

* Drowsiness detection system for the trucking industry is an important safety feature that can prevent road accidents caused by fatigue and drowsiness.

* The system works by monitoring the driver's behaviors such as the frequency of blinking and duration of time eye was closed. 

* When the system detects that the driver is getting drowsy, it warns them through audible alerts and vibrations, so they take the necessary action, 
such as taking a break or drinking coffee.â€‹
